  "summary": "The diff demonstrates comprehensive implementation of both requirements. REQ-1 is addressed through client-side validation, actor readiness checks, structured data formatting, and proper error handling with user feedback. REQ-2 is extensively implemented with detailed console logging throughout the submission flow, error categorization, and inline validation messages. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the code changes.",
